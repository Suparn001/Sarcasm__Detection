Project Overview: Analyzing Sentiment in Tweets Regarding Ukraine-Russia Conflict

Project Description:
This project focuses on analyzing the sentiment of tweets related to the Ukraine-Russia conflict. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and sentiment analysis, we aim to gain insights into the public's sentiments expressed on social media regarding the geopolitical situation.

Tools and Libraries Used:
Python: The entire project is implemented in Python, leveraging its powerful libraries for data analysis and natural language processing.

Libraries:

textblob for sentiment analysis.
nltk for natural language processing tasks.
pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.
Data Collection:
The project uses a dataset containing tweets related to the Ukraine-Russia conflict. The dataset is preprocessed to remove duplicates and non-English tweets.

Data Preprocessing:
Date Slicing: The date column is sliced to remove the time portion, providing a clearer understanding of when the tweets were posted.

Language Filtering: Non-English tweets are removed from the dataset to focus on English-language content.

Text Cleaning: Special characters, URLs, and retweet indicators are removed from the tweet content. The text is then converted to lowercase for consistency.

Sentiment Analysis:
Sentiment analysis is performed using both TextBlob and the VADER sentiment analyzer. Each tweet is classified as positive, negative, or neutral based on the sentiment scores.

Data Visualization:
Pie Chart: Displays the distribution of positive, negative, and neutral sentiments in the entire dataset.

Temporal Analysis Plot: Shows how the sentiment distribution changes over time. The x-axis represents dates, while the y-axis represents the percentage of tweets with positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

Conclusion:
The project aims to provide insights into the sentiment of social media users regarding the Ukraine-Russia conflict. The combination of TextBlob and VADER sentiment analysis techniques offers a comprehensive view of sentiment, and the visualizations help in understanding how sentiments evolve over time.
